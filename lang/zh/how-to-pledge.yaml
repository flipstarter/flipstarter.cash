title: How to support a Flipstarter campaign
intro: As described in the <a href="https://read.cash/@flipstarter/introducing-flipstarter-695d4d50" target="_blank">introduction to Flipstarter</a>, the first version uses a special type of transaction called Anyone-Can-Pay. It guarantees that your pledge can only be used if the campaign reaches its full target. Due to lack of wallet support at this time, you will have to do more than just point your phone at a QR code. We will get to the QR code version in future versions of Flipstarter technology! Also please let your favorite wallet know if support for Flipstarter technology is important to you.

  warning: "Warning: As always with wallets, only install Electron Cash and plugins from a source that you trust. Get a second opinion if you are not sure. A malicious plugin will have full access to your computer."
  get: Get <a href="https://electroncash.org/" target="_blank">Electron Cash</a> if you do not have it already.
  text: Make sure that the BCH you want to pledge is in a standard wallet. Most people will have standard wallets. If your pledge BCH is in a multi-sig or hardware wallet, you will need to send the pledge amount to a standard wallet first. If you do not know what multi-sig or hardware wallets are, then you do not need to worry about it.

  step-2: Click <code>Cancel all pledges</code> and follow the directions.
cancel:
  title: How to cancel your pledge manually
  intro: When you make a pledge with the Flipstarter plugin, it creates one coin with exactly your pledge amount and "freezes" it so that you do not accidentally spend it. You can see it in the <code>Coins</code> tab of Electron Cash. You might need to click <code>View</code> --> <code>Show Coins</code> if you do not have a Coins tab.
  intro-2: To cancel the pledge, you need to un-freeze it and also spend it back to yourself. We recommend you ask for help from Flipstarter or someone else who is familiar with Electron Cash if you are concerned about any of these steps.
  list:
    item-1: Click on the <code>Receive Tab</code></li>
    item-2: Copy the <code>Receiving address</code></li>
    item-3: Click on the <code>Coins</code> tab.</li>
    item-4: Find the frozen coin (blue highlighting) that is labeled as a <code>Flipstarter pledge</code>.</li>
    item-5: Right-click that coin and <code>Unfreeze Coin</code>.</li>
    item-6: Right-click that coin again and <code>Spend</code>.</li>
    item-7: Paste the address that you copied in step 2.</li>
    item-8: Click <code>Max</code></li>
    item-9: Click <code>Send</code> and do any required confirmation.</li>
  outro: Now your pledge was unfrozen and spent to yourself so that the campaign can no longer use it.
  outro-2: Actually you can un-freeze your pledged coin and spend it at any time even during a campaign. If you spend it, the campaign will detect and remove your pledge so don't worry if you need to cancel.
