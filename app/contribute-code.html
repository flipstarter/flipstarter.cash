        <p>The Flipstarter team is a group of volunteers, and we welcome contributions.</p>

        <p>General guidelines:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Submit merge requests for the campaign backend and frontend <a href="https://gitlab.com/flipstarter/backend/-/merge_requests">here</a>.</li>
          <li>Submit merge requests for this Electron Cash plugin <a href="https://gitlab.com/flipstarter/flipstarter-electron-cash/-/merge_requests">here</a>.</li>
          Keep each change minimal and self-contained. Note that "minimal" does not <li>always mean small, but usually it does.</li>
          Avoid mixing moving stuff around with changing stuff. Do changes with <li>renames on their own.</li>
          Code review is an important part of the development process. Contributors <li>and maintainers should expect constructive communication from each other.</li>
          In some cases, merge requests are rejected. It is up to the MR author to <li>convince the reviewers that the changes warrant the review effort.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Suggested workflow:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Find or create an issue describing a need or problem that needs to be solved.</li>
          <li><span class="text-warning">Optional</span> - If you are interested in a bounty, please follow this guideline. Generally speaking, there should be no expectation of a bounty until the maintainers agree on the details and content.</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Create a thread on the issue to discuss your proposal and bounty.</li>
            <li>Propose a problem to be solved (any clarification to the issue), the outline of a solution and a bounty.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Bounties are only paid in Bitcoin Cash.</li>
              <li>Bounties are typically denominated in USD.</li>
              <li>BCH conversion rates are determined at the time of transfer, typically by the Electron Cash wallet's price source.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Review and revise the proposal with the maintainers.</li>
            <li>Flipstarter team pays the bounty from public donations after a successful review, revision and merge process.</li>
          </ol>
          <li>Create a Merge/Pull Request with the proposed changes.</li>
          <li>Work with maintainers to review and revise the proposed changes.</li>
          <li>Maintainers merge changes if/when they meet Flipstarter needs.</li>
        </ol>
